I was looking at the program of finding the longest common prefix among an array of Strings. I was able to look at the testing input and figure out the answer easily(for small input). But to instruct a computer to do the same thing that my brain just did, I have to write code. Then a thought came into my brain that what if this is the exact or **something similar** program that is present inside our brain?  

In the book "[How to create a mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_Mind)" by Ray Kurzweil, he is talking about these groups of neurons capable of doing certain kinds of computation for pattern recognition. These groups of neurons are like computation units responsible for doing certain computations. 

What if the human brain is using some kind of two for loop to identify the longest common prefix? Itâ€™s so amazing to think of a block of code as a group of neurons performing a computation to output a useful result. You can think of these group neurons as a group of transistors running the block of code and giving results. It is so amazing to think about this idea specially while writing code and pondering that what if this is the exact thing that is happening inside my brain?
 

In the computer world, code is just instructions that a human give to perform a specific task, but who give instructions to our brain? **I think what we get after learning is the instructions (a kind of algorithm) inside our brains, just like inference in machine learning after training the model on data.**

Maybe there is something very similar going on inside our brain too or maybe there is a completely different system or physics that we yet don't know. That's the thing worth exploring.
