**Reflections**

A couple of months ago this year on a Sunday I called 6 of my friends, and surprisingly all of them picked up the phone. I talked to them on average for 1 hour each. For context, some of them I knew from kindergarten and some became friends in college. I either knew their childhood, their teenage years, or their early twenties. Now the majority of them are earning pretty decent salaries and living a comfortable life. In childhood, they were very ambitious, like thinking of doing something novel, something no other is doing. But now I noticed, since we are all almost of the same age (24-25), each of them I called, he/she said that they are doing the job and not a single friend is feeling fulfilled from their job. Everyone is living a dull (नीरस) life. And the only thing they think will help them is a better salary and an ideal partner. Everyone is feeling handicapped maybe by capitalism or I don't know why they are feeling handicapped, why they are feeling helpless. Everyone is saying “This is how life is, what we can do” or “It is what it is”.
I don’t know why they abandoned their dreams and started getting comfortable in the mediocre life that they are living. I can ask myself the same question. Maybe I have an answer. Even for myself, I was starting to get a comfortable, predictable path that my parents, my friends, and the whole society expected me to follow. The reason probably is that I have realized that there is a very high probability that I will live a medicare life and it's very hard to do otherwise. It is very hard to take “ the road not taken”. During childhood, you can dream but When reality slaps you, only then do you get to know what you are capable of or how hard it is to increase your capability.
You feel that you are “not extraordinary”, that you are “unique just like everyone else”. This feeling sucks.
