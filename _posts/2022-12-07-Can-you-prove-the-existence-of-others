The thought that ‘**I can only confirm my existence is frightening, self-centered, and at the same time liberating**'. Think about it, you can only know that you are alive, you can only know about your brain, and you can only listen to your thoughts directly.

You communicate with others through language or gestures but this doesn't confirm their existence. Whether they are conscious like you. It’s like the whole universe is built around 'you' and most importantly for '**you**’.

This thought is just another branch that originated from the simulation theory(that we are all in just a simulation), but the difference is that you are the only one who is 'real' in this simulation. Your mother, father, brother, sister, friends and the random people you see around are just not 'real' like you. Here the meaning of real is conscious or maybe something else. This thought is frightening because you are alone in this whole thing, self-centered because it makes you more self-obsessed and liberating because you don't care about others as they are not real.

When you talk to someone, you can easily observe that you can only confirm that you are a conscious being, the other person is like a black box for you. You can try to predict the black box but you cannot accurately predict its outcome(their response). That's why designing a test(like the Turing test) for confirming whether someone is conscious (for other humans or machines) is difficult. How can you disapprove that they are just NPCs (a character in a video game played by a computer) that are there just for you, for your entertainment, for your distraction, for your growth, for you to hate, for you to love, and finally for you to evolve?

Kinda strange, but can be true. BYE!
