I am not saying evolution is good or bad. I am typing this article because of evolution. I am just exploring how it is responsible for things that we sometimes don't think about. As we know that evolution made us this amazing dominating species capable of doing amazing things but on the other side I think it also made us miserable.

Evolution ‘**engineered**’ us to always be busy surviving and then reproducing.

Back then the consequence of laziness was not less salary than others but death.

Humans didn't have the option of being lazy. The task of just surviving commands your attention so much that you don’t have time to feel an existential crisis, nihilism, or stuff like that. Back then the meaning of life was not dying until you do. (you’ll never care about your pending project when a lion is chasing you in the jungle). Now in this modern world, surviving is not an issue. You have access to food and animals are not chasing you on the streets.

But now you need satisfaction from your work, from your relationship, and your life. No matter what you do, nothing will make you completely satisfied (that is how we are built at the very core level because it is important for our survival.) You need a constant important task that keeps you busy and commands your attention completely. And finding this thing in the modern world is difficult. You can never find this thing that is just perfect. You can only find things that are close to perfect.(asymptotic function). You have to understand the fact that our hardware is old (brain), but the software (that includes information from current society, the internet, or TikTok) we are running on it is not completely compatible.

In short, evolution doesn’t allow complete satisfaction. That is the main reason we have such a brain that needs constant information or action and that is the reason TikTok or YouTube are earning billions. We need a constant input of information or output of action, our brains can't stay calm at all. Even the laziest person can not stay free or calm, he needs movies, music, or drugs to pass time.

The reason for discussing all of the above stuff is to understand the '**why**' of what you are feeling and doing every day, all the time.
